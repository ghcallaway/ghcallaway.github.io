# ghcallaway.github.io
# Hadley Callaway ghcallaway@my.waketech.edu
# This is the repository I created which is visible to the public.
# It will contain the description of my programming project.
# I created a GitHub account, then downloaded desktop.github, then cloned the ghcallaway.github.io repository to my desktop. Then I linked it to the Visual Studio code editor. That is what I am using now.
